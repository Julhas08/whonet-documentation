Data entry can be accomplished at the national level by technical staff of the network coordinating institution who receives data submitted on paper forms from participating facilities. In the case of data entry into WHONET at the level of participating facilities, electronic WHONET data files are sent to the national level; at the national level WHONET data files from different facilities are combined and aggregated to the GLASS exchange format.

Further information about BacLink is provided as an Annex in this manual and can also be found in the BacLink tutorial BacLink 1 – Getting started which is available from http://www.whonet.org/documentation.html.

                                <p align="justify">WHONET requires a computer running Microsoft Windows versions XP or later, and also requires that Windows .NET version 4.0 is installed. After downloading the software, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions on the screen (“Run”, “OK”, etc.).  If you receive a message about “insufficient administrative rights” to install the software, you will need to contact your facility’s system administrator to install the software for you or to grant you the necessary local administration rights temporarily.</p>
                                <p align="justify">  
                                The default location for the WHONET installation is C:\WHONET\.  You may change this as you wish.  For example, if you would like to use WHONET on a network drive to permit shared use by multiple staff members, you can install the software to a common drive such as T:\WHONET\.  </p>
                                <p align="justify">In case you already have an older version of WHONET (prior to “WHONET 2016”) on your PC, then you may install the updated WHONET applications side by side in different folders and copy your data and configuration files to the new folders. This method will retain your ability to use the older version of the software. Alternatively, you can use the browse feature to locate the configuration files without copying them.
                                After installing the programme, you will find the WHONET and BacLink icons on your computer’s desktop.
                                Note:   If you have an antivirus, or system protection software installed such as Microsoft SmartScreen, Norton Antivirus, Symantec Antivirus, etc., it is possible that you may encounter a warning message similar to the following:</p>

                                <img src="glass/install-whonet.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  Installing WHONET" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">

                                <p align="justify">This message appears because the software is new and has not been installed on many systems, so the antivirus software notifies you that you should take extra precaution. It does not indicate a problem with the installation package. To proceed, you must follow your system’s prompts to continue with the installation. It may be necessary to open your computer’s downloads folder in order to locate the installation package.</p>

                                    National data managers who receive paper forms from participating surveillance sites need to enter data at the national level. The first step is to create a GLASS data format-compatible laboratory. You may wish to create one laboratory for each participating surveillance site (see section 3.2 for “Copying existing laboratory configuration”) or a single “national” laboratory that can be utilized for analysing and managing data from any of the participating facilities in the country.
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify">
                                    Where participating surveillance sites submit electronic WHONET data files to the national level, the data manager may first want to create a GLASS laboratory to combine data into one WHONET file (line-level data) and subsequently aggregate data to the GLASS exchange format (see section 6 for exporting WHONET files to the GLASS exchange format).</p>
                                    <p align="justify">

                                    To configure a GLASS laboratory:
                                    Start WHONET, the screen below appears, click “Cancel” </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Then the main WHONET screen appears. Click “File”, select “GLASS“ and click  “New laboratory”, the following screen appears:</p>

                                    <p align="justify"> Indicate your country, laboratory name and laboratory code, then click “OK”.
                                    The screen below appears:</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Choose your configuration type. Data entered through either method will be usable for GLASS export. Indeed, WHONET files created by any method can be exported to GLASS formats.  The minimal GLASS configuration reflects the GLASS standards outlined in the WHO GLASS Manual for Early Implementation.  The standard configuration will allow for more extensive data entry and analysis options in addition to GLASS requirements.</p>
                                     
                                    <p align="justify">The screen below appears:</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Select the guidelines used at the laboratory and click “OK”.
                                    With the minimal GLASS configuration WHONET will create a new laboratory with the recommended set of GLASS antibiotics, data fields and codes. You will then be prompted with the following screen.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">If you want to review the configuration and make any additional modifications, select “Yes” and follow instructions in section 3.3 and Annex 1.  Otherwise, select “No” to proceed directly with WHONET data entry and analysis.
                                    Before you start with data entry we recommend that you review to check if it is necessary to make changes to the antibiotic interpretative breakpoints. For details of how to make any additional changes please refer to section 3.3 and Annex 1.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">When using the feature “Create a new GLASS laboratory”, WHONET defines a laboratory configuration with a list of antibiotics and data fields. However, the data manager may wish to further customize the configuration to more closely match data entry, analysis and reporting needs on site and at the national level.  </p>

                                    <h4>Options include:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li><strong>General information:</strong>  The user may modify the laboratory code, full laboratory name and country code.  The user can also specify whether isolates of human origin will be collected primarily or whether human, animal, food and/or environmental isolates are to be collected in one database.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Data fields:</strong>  When the “Create a new GLASS laboratory” feature was used, WHONET created a list of “minimal GLASS” or “standard WHONET” data fields, such as “Identification number”, “Specimen type” and “Pathogen”. The user may add or remove data fields from this list to more closely match data management preferences, for example “Patient last name” or “Diagnosis”.  </li>

                                    <li> <strong>Locations:</strong>  A list of patient care areas may be created for the laboratory configuration e.g. “Emergency Room”, “General medical ward” and “Surgical intensive care unit”.  This will be particularly useful if the user plans to use WHONET for purposes of clinical reporting or data analysis on site. If data for this variable are to be combined at the national level with data from different facilities, a standardized list of patient care areas must be implemented by the coordinating centre.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong>  Antibiotics may be added or removed from the antibiotic list established for the laboratory configuration so that it more closely matches the set of antibiotics tested on site or considered under surveillance at the national level. “Antibiotic panels” may be defined, which control the organism-specific list of antibiotics displayed to the user during data entry or “antibiotic profiles” used in the WHONET data analysis module. The breakpoints automatically defined by WHONET can be reviewed and edited in this module.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <p>Further details on these configuration features can be found in Annex 1.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the following section the variables of the GLASS minimal configuration laboratory are described. Most of them are required for generating the GLASS exchange format (GLASS aggregated data files). If the user has configured the laboratory to requirements different from the GLASS protocol, additional data entry fields may appear. </p>

                                    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 30px;">Note:   GLASS is collecting data not only on “positive” results (GLASS priority pathogens) but also on the overall number of clinical specimens submitted to the laboratory for species isolation and identification. That means, for example for blood specimens, information on isolates other than the GLASS priority pathogens and also “negative” results should be included in the aggregated GLASS data submission. WHONET has implemented this approach in the GLASS sample file, providing the information is entered on site; the overall number of samples for the respective specimen is aggregated in the sample file. For more details on data entry in WHONET see below under “Pathogen”. More information on the approach and methodology can be found in the GLASS Manual for Early Implementation  and the GLASS guide to preparing aggregated AMR data files. </p>

                                    <h4>Unique patient identifier</h4>

                                    <p align="justify">Enter a unique patient identifier (ID) for each patient with a maximum of 12 characters. Several specimens and isolates can be assigned to each patient and corresponding unique ID. The unique patient ID is required for de-duplication that is automatically done by WHONET software when generating the GLASS exchange format (see also section 6.3).</p>
                                    <h4>Date of birth</h4>

                                    <p align="justify">To enter the date of birth see instructions on the previous page regarding the format. Alternatively the user may wish to enter the patient’s age (see “Age”). When generating the GLASS exchange format, age will be aggregated into the GLASS pre-defined age group category.</p>

                                    <h4>Gender </h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">Enter “m” for male and “f” for female. Missing values will be reported in the GLASS aggregated data file as unknown.</p>

                                    <h4>Age</h4>

                                    <p align="justify">The option of entering the patient’s age exists. However, if the patient’s date of birth has been entered, the patient’s age will automatically be calculated and inserted in the age field when the specimen date is entered. When generating the GLASS exchange format, age will be grouped in the GLASS pre-defined age group category.</p>

                                    <h4>Date of admission </h4>

                                    <p align="justify">Enter the date of hospital (inpatient) admission (see previous page for date format). Date of admission is a field required to calculate “hospital origin”.</p>

                                    <h4>Location type</h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">Select the location type (ward type). It is important to indicate the patient’s location as the calculation of the GLASS variable “origin” (community or hospital, see “infection origin” below) is based on an algorithm in the WHONET software that requires the variable’s location type. As a minimum enter outpatient or inpatient respectively. For hospitalized patients, the “date of admission” and “specimen date” are also required. Missing values will result in unknown “origin” in the GLASS aggregated data file.</p>

                                    <h4>Infection origin</h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">The GLASS protocol defines “origin” as community- or hospital-acquired infection (see also the GLASS Manual for Early Implementation and the GLASS document “ A guide to preparing aggregated AMR data files” for more details). WHONET software calculates “Infection origin” using a combination of data entry fields. In order for the software to calculate this field, three data fields are needed: location type; and for hospitalized patients - specimen date and the date of admission. The rules for calculating the “Infection origin” (corresponding to the GLASS “origin”) are as follows: All location types of “out” (coded value for outpatient) will result in the isolate being reported to GLASS as “Community”. If admission date and specimen date are provided, and location type is “in” (coded value for inpatient), the system will verify that the admission date occurred more than two days prior to the specimen’s collection. If this is true, the isolate will be marked “Hospital”, otherwise it will be marked “Community”. If the system cannot determine the “Infection origin”, usually due to missing data, it will be reported as “Unknown” to GLASS.</p>

                                    <h4>Surveillance site </h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">Enter the surveillance site (maximum 3 letters laboratory code) or choose “other” in the event that the patient has not been cared for at the surveillance site. 
                                    Specimen number 
                                    Enter a number for each specimen with a maximum of 12 characters. 
                                    The specimen number may be helpful for data validation purposes when, for example, several isolates from the same patient are entered.  
                                    <h4>Specimen date</h4>
                                    Enter the date the specimen was taken (see previous page for date format). This field is required to calculate the “Infection origin”.
                                    <h4>Specimen type</h4>
                                    Enter the specimen type from the GLASS list that is displayed on the right half of the screen. Two lists are available to the user – the short “GLASS list” with four specimen types (“Blood”, “Genital”, “Stool” and “Urine”); or the “Standard WHONET list” with a much larger number of specimen types e.g. “Cerebrospinal fluid”, “Sputum”, “Joint fluid”, etc. Choose the list that is most appropriate for your needs. </p>

                                    <h4>Pathogen</h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">The 3-character WHONET organism code should be entered here, or selected from the GLASS pathogen list on the right half of the screen that is displayed by default for the minimal GLASS configuration. To view the standard or extended list and to enter information on isolates other than the GLASS priority pathogens, select ”standard” or “extended” respectively from the drop down option. To enter data for specimens submitted to the laboratory but with “negative” results (“no isolate growth”) leave the pathogen field blank or use the WHONET code “xxx” signifying “No growth”, and press the “Save isolate” button on the upper right screen and proceed as prompted. The specimen will be correctly included in the GLASS sample file. More information on the approach and methodology can be found in the GLASS Manual for Early Implementation and the GLASS document “A guide to preparing aggregated AMR data files”.</p>

                                    <h4>Antibiotic panel</h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">The antibiotic panel displayed by default shows the antibiotics for the selected organism proposed by GLASS for reporting. If the user changes the panel to “All antibiotics”, then it is possible to select from any of the antibiotics on the list.</p>

                                    <h4>Susceptibility results and the list of antibiotics</h4>

                                    <p align="justify">To enter susceptibility results, first click on the appropriate test method – disk diffusion, MIC or ETest.  The list of antibiotics for that test method appears. Each time a result is entered press <Enter>: the cursor then jumps to the next antibiotic on the antibiotic panel for the organism tested.  </p>

                                    <h4>Entering susceptibility results</h4>
                                    
                                    <p align="justify">WHONET allows the entry of quantitative results (e.g. 13 mm, 64 µg/ml) or the entry of qualitative results (R = resistant, I = intermediate, S = susceptible).
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify">  
                                    The lowest possible zone diameter is 6 mm. If 0 mm is entered (indicating no inhibition), WHONET will automatically change this to 6 mm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify">

                                    For off-scale MIC values the following, for example, may be entered:  <=.5, >64. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify">If MIC results from the test of a drug combination are being entered (e.g. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), enter the result of the first or principal agent. These concentrations usually follow the 1, 2, 4, 8 … doubling-dilution series.</p>

                                    <h4>Saving the isolate information</h4>

                      <p align="justify">The previous sections covered the entry of data into WHONET. This can be accomplished by staff at each of the surveillance sites participating in the national surveillance system or alternatively at the national level by the surveillance system coordinators utilizing paper forms or electronic records received from participating facilities.</p>
                      <p align="justify">If data entry is accomplished by the participating facilities, then data entry staff should periodically send their WHONET data files securely to the national programme coordinators. For purposes of GLASS data preparation, annual data submissions to the national coordinators may prove sufficient.  However, to support the needs of the national surveillance programme, more frequent submissions, for example monthly, are recommended in order to recognize and respond to emerging threats.</p>

                      <p align="justify">If facilities already have electronic data stores, for example in a laboratory information system or a laboratory organism and identification susceptibility test instrument, then BacLink – WHONET’s data import module – can usually be utilized to import the data into WHONET. Further details are available in the BacLink tutorials, starting with BacLink 1 – Getting started which is available from http://www.whonet.org/documentation.html.  BacLink can be run at the local level directly by facility staff members. Alternatively, national network coordinators can receive raw data files from participating facilities and convert these into WHONET files using BacLink at the national level, as introduced in Annex 2 and described further in a series of BacLink tutorials.</p>

                      <p>There are 2 scenarios for WHONET files:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Data have been entered manually at the national level following the instructions provided in the previous sections; or</li>
                          <li>electronic files in WHONET format have been received from participating surveillance sites.</li>
                        </ul>  
                        <h4><strong>Manual data entry</strong></h4>

                        <p align="justify">After manual data entry the files are saved in WHONET format. Before uploading them to the GLASS user interface, they must be exported to the GLASS data exchange format. It is possible that the user may have national WHONET data stored in a single large WHONET file, or alternatively, the user may have separate WHONET files representing various facilities, specimens and time periods. If multiple files exist, the user may first wish to combine them together into a single large WHONET file using the procedure described below (section 6.1).</p>

                        <h4><strong>Electronic data entry</strong></h4>
                        
                        <p align="justify">After receiving electronic WHONET data files from participating surveillance sites the user may first want to combine data files from more than one surveillance site into a single large WHONET file. However, surveillance sites may use different WHONET software versions and different laboratory configurations. If the laboratories are testing exactly the same antibiotics with the same set of breakpoints, the data files can be combined using any one of the corresponding laboratory configurations. On the other hand, if the laboratories are testing different antibiotics or using different breakpoints, then a new “national” laboratory configuration should be created and customized that includes a list of all antibiotics tested (with the corresponding breakpoints), as mentioned earlier in Sections 3.1 and 3.3.</p>

                                      <p>Both files should be uploaded to the GLASS IT platform.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">The RIS file includes aggregated data submitted from all participating national surveillance sites on the number of resistant, intermediate and susceptible isolates detected in GLASS priority specimens and pathogens, stratified by gender, origin and age. </p>

                                      <p align="justify">The sample file with “Sample statistics” includes the numbers of patients with specimens taken, stratified by the same variables as in the RIS file. That means the sample file will also include, for example, data on “negative” results provided these data were entered and are available in the source database (see also section 4.2, page 13, Pathogen). </p>

                                      <p align="justify">By default, WHONET will save the new files in the C:\WHONET\Output folder named as following: GLASS-3 letter country code-data year-data set-file (RIS or Sample), though the user can change this if desired. For example:</p>

                                        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 30px;">Ensure that the proposed WHONET “Data year” is the reporting year, otherwise change accordingly.

                                        <p align="justify">Note:   Only data with the corresponding specimen date (year) and “data year” is included in the aggregated files. That means a specimen is included in the aggregated files, if specimen date is “01-01-2015” and if “data year” is “2015”; the specimen will be excluded in the aggregated files, if specimen date is “01-01-2015” and if “data year” is “2016”.</p>

                                        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 30px;">“Data set” allows one to distinguish subsets of national aggregated data provided by a country where, for some reason, it is not possible to aggregate national data in the same way or when dividing the national data set has an important added value. This may be needed, for example, if the country has several different surveillance systems or there is a need to report data from different parts of the country separately. This may also be needed if, for example, the sample statistics (needed for generating a sample file) are missing in a large part of the country (see also the GLASS document “ A guide to preparing aggregated AMR data files” for more details). From the drop-down option, select the “Data set” code. Make sure it is the corresponding code for both RIS and sample file. The default option is “Data set 1” (code “DS1”).</p>

                                        <p align="justify">The user can select the specimen types to include in the GLASS aggregated data file (per default all 4 GLASS specimens are included). If the user wishes to include only, for example, blood, make sure to choose blood for the RIS and the sample file. </p>

                                    <p align="justify">According to GLASS protocol, “repeat isolates” (“duplicates”) from a patient should be excluded. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document “M39 – Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Statistics” recommends that laboratories use the first isolate per species for the analysed time period and data subset when calculating susceptibility and resistance proportions for purposes of developing guidelines for empiric therapy. When generating the GLASS export file, WHONET automatically removes repeats following this recommendation – “first isolate per patient” regardless of susceptibility results. Consistent with the CLSI recommendation for data subsets, the WHONET export to GLASS will select the first isolate from each specimen type and “Infection origin”, e.g. E. coli first isolates from urine and from blood from the same patient will both be included in the GLASS export files.  </p>

The “WHONET antibiotic list” appears on the left, while the antibiotics     that the user may want to select will appear on the right under “Local antibiotic list”.    The list on the right will already contain GLASS antibiotics if the user has chosen the     GLASS laboratory configuration.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">STEP 2:   For each combination of antibiotic, method and testing guidelines:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Select the correct testing guidelines (CLSI, EUCAST, etc.); and</li>
                                      <li>click on the correct test method (disk diffusion, MIC, ETest); and</li>
                                      <li>select the correct antibiotic (and disk potency for disk diffusion testing).</li>

                                    <p align="justify">Once all the antibiotics have been entered, review the list and make any needed corrections. To remove an antibiotic from the local antibiotic list, double-click on the antibiotic or single-click on the antibiotic and hit the left arrow button “<--“.  The sequence of the antibiotics may be changed using the “Move up” and “Move down” buttons.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Note:   Each antibiotic test is given a code (up to nine letters) consisting of:  the three-letter  antibiotic code, a one-letter code indicating the guideline reference (e.g. N=CLSI, formerly  NCCLS, E=EUCAST), a one-letter code indicating the test method (D=disk diffusion, M=MIC,  E=ETest), and a disk potency for drugs tested by disk diffusion. For MIC or ETest it is only  necessary to select the correct antibiotic and correct guideline – the disk potency indicated   is not relevant. For example, the code GEN_ND10 represents:  gentamicin, CLSI (NCCLS), disk   diffusion, 10 µg, while GEN_EM is: gentamicin, EUCAST, MIC.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">STEP 3:   When satisfied with the list, the user can choose from the following options:</p>

                                    <li> “OK” to return to main “Laboratory configuration” screen. Note the information has  to be saved by clicking on “Save” in the main “Laboratory configuration” screen.</li>
                                    <li> “Panels” and “Profiles” are optional: to facilitate data entry, the user may wish to use “Panels” to indicate which antibiotics are tested for each kind of organism. For details refer to the complete WHONET manual.</li>
                                    <li> “Print”: obtain a printout of the antibiotics and their breakpoints. It is recommended that breakpoints are printed for review and reference before data entry  commences.</li>
                                    <li> “Breakpoints”: to review, modify and update the antibiotic breakpoints. See next section 3 “Antibiotic breakpoints”.</li>

                                    <p align="justify">STEP 2: The following options are available:</p>

                                    <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                      <li>“General”: review and edit the list of general disk diffusion or MIC breakpoints. For details, see STEP 3A.</li>
                                      <li> “Species-specific”: review and edit the list of species-specific disk diffusion or MIC breakpoints. For details, see STEP 3B.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                      
                                    <p align="justify">“Expert interpretation rules”: These are not required for GLASS data management. Refer to the complete WHONET manual for further details.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">“Update breakpoints”: The WHONET antibiotic definition files are updated annually as new recommendations from the reference authorities become available. If the user downloads WHONET on an annual basis, the download will include the new breakpoints. WHONET will not automatically use these new breakpoints for an existing antibiotic list until the user clicks on “Update breakpoints” to replace the breakpoints that have been set for the laboratory with the antibiotic breakpoints to be found in the most recent antibiotic definition files.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">“OK”:  When finished reviewing or modifying the antibiotic breakpoints, selecting “OK” will return the user to the “Antibiotic configuration” screen.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>This example illustrates the procedure:</strong></h4>

                                    <p align="justify">Editing General breakpoints:  Click on Disk diffusion “General” breakpoints: the screen below appears. (If the option for MIC and ETest breakpoints is selected, the same type of screen will appear.)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Note:   Since 2013, WHONET no longer defines “General” breakpoints for EUCAST.  Instead all breakpoints are associated with specific species and can be found under “Species-specific breakpoints”.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Click on any breakpoint values that are to be changed. The relevant values may be edited under “R”, “I”, or “S”.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Note:   If the user changes a value e.g. for “I”, the other values change accordingly.</p>

In most countries, changes to these WHONET-provided reference breakpoints are not required.  However, if the user wishes to make modifications to the breakpoints, changes to the table breakpoints below may be made using the same procedure as described in STEP 3A.</p>
