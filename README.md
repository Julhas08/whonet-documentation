WHONET is a free software developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance for laboratory-based surveillance of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

The principal goals of the software are:

    to enhance local use of laboratory data; and
    to promote national and international collaboration through the exchange of data.

WHONET can be used by individual laboratories or as part of a national and international surveillance network. At present, the software, available in 17 languages, is used in over 80 countries around the world managing data from over 1000 clinical, public health, veterinary, and food laboratories.

WHONET analytical tools facilitate:

    the understanding of the local epidemiology of microbial populations;
    the selection of antimicrobial agents;
    the identification of hospital and community outbreaks; and
    the recognition of quality assurance problems in laboratory testing.

Note: At present, WHONET can handle results from the testing of bacteria, fungi, and parasites. WHONET does not yet have virological tests incorporated, but this is a priority area of programming in the upcoming year.
