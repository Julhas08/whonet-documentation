                                            WHONET permits the customization of the software for use in your institution.  You can indicate which antimicrobials you test in the laboratory, patient care areas served, data fields that you want to include in the surveillance program, and microbiological alerts of unusual or important organisms and resistance phenotypes. </li>
                                            <li> <strong>Data entry and clinical reporting: </strong>
                                            WHONET allows the routine entry of susceptibility test results as well as the retrieval, correction and printing of clinical records.  During data entry, WHONET can provide immediate feedback to technicians on important strain phenotypes.</li>

                                           <li> <strong>Data analysis:</strong> 
                                            WHONET has a user-friendly interface permitting many types of analysis.  Options include isolate line-listings and summaries, such as organism frequencies over time, antimicrobial susceptibility test statistics, zone diameter and MIC histograms, antibiotic scatterplots and regression curves, and antibiotic resistance profile line-listings and summaries.  WHONET also has a number of alert features which permit the detection of unlikely or important results as well as possible hospital or community outbreaks of bacterial or non-bacterial species. </li>

                                          </ul>

                                          <p>Examples of some of the WHONET analysis options are shown below. </p>

                                          <p align="justify">Many laboratories in the world already have computer systems for managing microbiological data.  Examples include:</p>
                                          1.  Simple desktop softwares such as Microsoft Excel, Access, or EpiInfo <br />
                                          2.  Laboratory test instruments, such as Vitek, MicroScan, and SensiTitre<br />
                                          3.  Commercial or in-house laboratory information systems.<br />

                                          <p align="justify">Most of these systems were developed for purposes of clinical reporting, billing, and day-to-day specimen processing needs.  Unfortunately, most systems have limited capabilities for analyzing data.  This is where WHONET can be a valuable add-on to your existing system.</p>

                                          <p align="justify">One way of getting data from your computer system into WHONET is through the manual re-entry of results directly into WHONET.  But this is can be a significant waste of valuable staff time and is subject to typing errors during the reentry of results.</p>

                                          <p align="justify">To avoid reentering results into WHONET, we have developed the BacLink software.  The purpose of the BacLink software is to facilitate the conversion of data from your computer system into WHONET.  You could do this interactively on a weekly, monthly, or ad hoc basis.  In a number of institutions, it has also been possible to automate and schedule the entire process.  BacLink is available free-of-charge from the World Health Organization as part of the WHONET package.</p>

                                          <p align="justify">By using BacLink, you can thus avoid the manual entry of results into WHONET.  A related benefit in the context of multi-center collaborations is the standardization of data from a number of incompatible data sources into one common structure that can be analyzed with WHONET.</p>

                                          <p align="justify">To learn more about BacLink and its use, go through the “BacLink – Getting Started”.</p>

                              <p align="justify">In this tutorial, indicate that the method is CLSI, and you will choose a few drugs tested by disk diffusion and a few tested by Etest.  To select an antibiotic, double-click on the antibiotic to move it to the right side of the screen or single-click on the antibiotic and hit the “–>” button.</p>

                              <p align="justify">Find the following antibiotics, and move them to the right side of the screen.</p>

                              <p align="justify">WHONET assigns a code to each antibiotic test, for example AMP_ND10 indicates a test of ampicillin (“AMP”) by CLSI (“N”, formerly NCCLS) methods by disk diffusion (“D”) with a 10ug disk (“10”).</p>

                              <p align="justify">Now enter a few drugs tested by Etest.  Click on the option labeled “Etest” and select the following drugs.  Since the disk potency is not relevant for Etests, it does not matter which ”ceftriaxone” you select from the WHONET list.</p>
                              <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                Etest, ceftiaxone<br />

                              <p align="justify">The corresponding test code for the ceftriaxone Etest done by CLSI (formerly NCCLS) methods would be CRO_NE.  After making these selections, you should have the following.

                              <p align="justify">Antibiotic breakpoints:  When you select antibiotic tests, WHONET automatically sets up the correct official breakpoints according to the reference body that you indicate.  In most cases, there will be no need for you to change these yourself.  However, if there are no official breakpoints for the antibiotic that you selected or if you disagree with the breakpoints used by WHONET, then you may wish to make some manual modifications. </p> 

                              <p align="justify">Note:  Accurate breakpoints are essential if you are entering quantitative test measurements into WHONET (for example, disk diffusion zone diameters or MIC/Etest values).  On the other hand, if you will only be entering test interpretations (“resistant”, “intermediate”, or “susceptible”), then WHONET does not use the breakpoint values.  WHONET does not require the use of test measurements, but for good quality microbiological testing and the most valuable analyses, it is strongly recommended.</p>

                              <p align="justify">In this tutorial, we will not change any of the default breakpoints, but to see the values suggested by WHONET, click on “Breakpoints”.  </p>

                              <p align="justify">You can then view any of the disk diffusion or MIC/Etest breakpoints.  WHONET distinguishes between “General” breakpoints used for most bacterial species and “Species-specific” breakpoints for species in which the recommended breakpoint is different.  After reviewing the breakpoints, select “OK”, “OK” to return to the antibiotic configuration screen.</p>

                              <p align="justify">Antibiotic panels:  If you will enter results manually into WHONET, it would be useful to the data entry person if you indicate which antibiotics are tested for which organism groups.  For example for S. aureus, the software should request results from drugs used in Gram-positive infections, while for E. coli in urine samples, a different set of antimicrobials would be appropriate.</p>

                              <p align="justify">From the Antibiotic configuration screen, click on “Panels”.  You will see all of the antibiotics that you have selected in the rows, and a list of various organism groupings in the columns.  Place a check mark to indicate which drugs are usually tested for each organism.</p>

                              <p align="justify">For this tutorial, put check marks for the following organisms and antibiotics.</p>

                              <p>“Staphylococcus”:  cefoxitin, erythromycin, penicillin, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin </p>

                              <p>“S. pneumoniae”:  erythromycin, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, penicillin-Etest, and ceftiaxone-Etest </p>
                              <p> 
                               “Gram-negative”.  ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole </p>

                              <p align="justify">If there is a drug that you test infrequently, for example imipenem for E. coli isolates, there is no need to include it in the panel.  The user will be able to enter results for either “panel” antibiotics or “all antibiotics” at the time of data entry.</p>

In this analysis bacteria are classified according to their multi-resistance phenotype.  This is a very valuable analysis for infection control staff when searching for outbreaks of multi-resistant organisms in the hospital setting.  Use and interpretation of this feature is described in the tutorial Data Analysis 2.</p>

                              <p align="justify">For most laboratories, this list is adequate for routine surveillance purposes and does not need to be edited.  However for many laboratories, modifications to this list can be very useful. </p> 

                              <p align="justify">Adding or removing fields:  You can add additional fields to the list or remove fields that you do not need for your work.  Click on “Modify list”.  On the left, you will see various categories of questions and suggested fields from you to choose from.  If you cannot find the field that you need, you may define a “User-defined field”.</p>

                              <p align="justify">For this tutorial, click on “Clinical information” as the data category and “Diagnosis” in the “Data fields” list.  Use the right-arrow key to pass “Diagnosis” to your laboratory’s field list.</p>

                              <p align="justify">Now click on “Microbiology” as the data category, and double-click on “D-Test (ERY, CLI)” to add this test to your list.  Then click “OK” to return to the previous screen.</p>

In this figure, you can see a number of additional microbiological questions from which to choose.  You can also select “User-defined” if the field you would like does not appear in the WHONET lists.</p>


                              <p align="justify">Changing field lengths:  WHONET assigns a default length for each data field, but the length of most fields can be changed by the user.  For example, the location code by default is at most six characters in length.  However, for many laboratories, six letters may not be sufficient.  To change the length, click on “Location”, and change the length on the right side of the screen from 6 to a larger value, for example 20.  For this tutorial, you can leave these settings unchanged.</p>

                              <p align="justify">Appearance of the data entry screen and isolate listings:  You can use “Move up” and “Move down” to change the order of the questions appearing on the data entry screen.  You can indicate whether a question applies to humans, animals, or food.  You can also indicate which “box” the question appears in during data entry, for example “Location”, “Microbiology”, “Specimen”, etc.  You can indicate that a question is hidden from the user by selecting “Hidden”, or whether to include a certain column in the default isolate listing by clicking on “Isolate listing”.  For this tutorial, you can leave these settings unchanged.</p>

                              <p align="justify">Code lists:  If you add some additional fields to your list, you may also wish to create a list of codes to use for these fields.  For this tutorial, click on the item “Diagnosis” that you added above.  Now click on “Code list”.  To enter a list of valid codes, click on “Use codes from the table below”.  Then put in the following entries under the “Description” and “Code” columns:  “pneumonia”=”pneumo”, “urinary tract infection”=”uti”, “meningitis”=”mening”.

                                  <p align="justify">Note:  For date formats, WHONET uses the defaults set up for your computer.  For example, if you type 10/12/05 on a computer outside of the United States, WHONET will probably (depending on your computer) interpret this as 10-Dec-05.  On the other hand, if you are in the United States, WHONET will probably interpret this as 12-Oct-05.  When WHONET displays the date back to you as “10-Dec-05” or “12-Oct-05”, you will see whether WHONET correctly interprets your intention.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Note:  In WHONET, you can enter either quantitative measurements (disk diffusion zone diameters or MIC values in ug/ml) or test interpretations (resistance, intermediate, susceptible).  However, we strongly recommend that you enter the test measurements for several reaons:</p>

                                  <p align="justify">1.  It is the correct way to do the test, and the only way to be certain that measurements and interpretations were done correctly, rather than “eye-balling” the result.</p>
                                  <p align="justify">2.  Interpretative breakpoints can change over time.  If there is a change in breakpoints, you will not be able to compare new statistics with your older statistics if you do not record the test measurements.</p>
                                  <p align="justify">3.  By reviewing the distribution histograms of test results, you can assess the quality of routine test practices and the reliability of results; and</p>
                                  <p align="justify">4.  By reviewing the test measurement, you can learn a lot about the mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiology of distinct resistant clones – useful both for research studies and infection control investigations of possible outbreaks.</p>


                                  <p align="justify">After you enter all of the results, click on “Save isolate”.  From the choices given, select “Save the isolate and continue with the same specimen.”</p>

                                    To print out clinical reports or logbook isolate listings, click on “Print” from either the main Data entry screen or from the “View database” screen.

                                  <p align="justify">You have the choice between printing isolate listings (for example fifty isolates per page) or individual patient reports (one to three reports per page).  You also have the option of choosing to print only the current isolate selected or a number of isolates with criteria that you specific (date of data entry, specimen number, etc.). <br/>

                                  For this tutorial, you will print clinical reports and an isolate listing for the four isolates entered above. <br />

                                  1.  Click on “Clinical reports”.  Choose “Select isolates”.  The default is to print out all isolates entered today (“Date of data entry” =  today’s date).  Click on “Print”, and then “Print” on the following screen.  WHONET will now print the individual clinical reports, two per page.</p>

                                  The following additional features are not essential, but are useful to many users.  For purposes of this tutorial, look at the screens that are described, but there is no need to run any of the features.  When you finish, select “File”, “Exit” to leave WHONET completely. <br />

                                  Combining data files:  In the above example, you created a data file for January 2006.  If you continue in this way, you will have twelve monthly files at the end of the year.  Many users find it convenient at the end of the year to combine the twelve files into a single larger monthly file.<br />

                                  To use this feature, click on “Data entry” from the main WHONET screen.  Choose “Combine or export data files”.  Indicate the data files that you want to combine and the name of the new file that you want to create.  Then click on “Combine”.  When WHONET finishes, the original data files will be unchanged, but you will now have a new large data file which includes all of the results from the original files.<br />
                                  </p>

                                  <p align="justify"> Encryption:  If you want to share your data files with other institutions, you may wish to protect the confidentiality of patients with this feature.  When you use this option, WHONET will create a copy of your data file but with patient and specimen information either removed or encrypted.  WHONET uses a uni-directional encryption, so subsequent “decryption” of the results is not possible.<br />

                                  To use this feature, click on “Data entry” from the main WHONET screen.  Choose “Encrypt data files”.  Indicate the data file that you want to encrypt and the name of the new file that you want to create.  Then click on “Encrypt”.  When WHONET finishes, the original data file will be unchanged, but you will now how a new data file in which the patient and sample information has either been removed or encrypted. </p>

                                  Data file locations:  When you install WHONET, by default, all data files will be saved into the c:\whonet5\data folder.  For people using WHONET on a single computer not connected to a network, this is a practical location.  However, for computers connected into a network, it if often more convenient to put the data files onto a central common computer where multiple users can have access to the same data files.  In this way, data entry and data analysis can be done with the same data files by several individuals using different computers.<br />

                                  If you save your data files on a network computer, it would be convenient for users if you change the default location for WHONET data files.  To do this, go to the main WHONET menu, and select “File”, “File locations”.  To change the location of the data files, you can type in the desired location or use the Browse option to find the appropriate folder.

                                  After checking this option, click on “OK” to return to the main WHONET menu.  Click on “File”, “Exit” to completely leave the WHONET program.<br />


                                  Backing up files:  As is true for any important document that you have on your computer, you should have a strategy for backing up your WHONET data files.  This is important in the case of computer damage, theft, viruses, or accidental modifications.  You can back files up by copying your WHONET files onto another computer, CD-ROM, USB-memory stick, or diskettes. <br />

                                  To make copies of your WHONET data files, go to c:\whonet5\data (or other location that you have selected), and find the files that you want to backup.  Select these files and choose “Edit” from the main Windows screen and “Copy”.  (Alternatively, you can use Ctrl-C or right-click on the file and select “Copy”.) <br />

                                  Then go to the location where you want to back up the files and select “Edit”, “Paste”.  (Or Ctrl-V or right-click on the location and select “Paste.”) <br />

                                  <br />
                                  Organism groups:  If you click on “Organism groups”, you will see that WHONET permits you to analyze groups of microorganisms such as “All organisms”, “All Enterobacteriaceae”, and “All Salmonella”.
                                  <br />
                                  Analyze as one organism:  WHONET generally will analyze each organism selected separately.  If you would like WHONET to average results together from multiple organisms (for example “Klebsiella pneumoniae”, “Klebsiella oxytoca” and “Klebsiella sp.”), then click on the option “Analyze as one organism”.

                                    <p align="justify">Figure 7.  WHONET output screen for the %RIS and test measurement analysis with E. coli.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">On the top of this screen, you see a table with the antimicrobial susceptibility test statistics for each of the antimicrobials tested.  If you want to sort the table alphabetically or numerically, click on the heading for the column on which you want to sort.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">For the E. coli, the output tells you how many isolates in total were found (86 isolates) and which antimicrobials were tested.  When you review results such as these, you should evaluate whether the antimicrobials tested are appropriate and whether the laboratory can optimize their test practices by adding, removing, or changing the antimicrobials tested.  The results may also suggested typing errors in data entry (for example if there are vancomycin results tabulated for E. coli).</p>

                                    <p align="justify">You should also look at the column “Number” to see how often each antimicrobial was tested.  This will give you an idea of the laboratory’s testing practices – which antimicrobials are tested in all isolates and which are tested only in urine or highly resistant isolates.  If the number of tests per antibiotic is very irregular, this may suggest a problem with antimicrobial disk availability in the laboratory.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">For example, in the data presented in this example, one could conclude that the laboratory staff is most likely testing antimicrobials in the following way:</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Tested for all isolates:  AMP, ATM, CTX, CXM, CEP, GEN, IPM, SXT (9 drugs)
                                    Tested for urine isolates:  AMC, NIT, NOR (3 drugs)
                                    Tested for non-urine isolates:  FOX, CIP, PIP (3 drugs)
                                    Tested for organisms resistant to first-line agents:  AMK, CAZ, TOB (3 drugs)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the other words, there is a urine panel which includes 12 antimicrobials (as one 15cm plate or two 9cm plates), a non-urine panel with 12 antimicrobials, and three additional drugs used in second-testing.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Additional columns indicate the antimicrobial breakpoints used, the percent of isolates resistant (including a 95% confidence interval), intermediate, and susceptible, as well as the distribution of zone diameters of MIC values. </p> 

                                    <p align="justify">The lower part of the screen shows some of the same data presented in the table, but in graphical format.  For example, click on the options for “Number tested” and “%Resistant”.</p>

                                       
                                    <img src="whonet/dta-1/figure-8.jpg" alt="Figure 2.  Running the analysis" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 

                                    <p align="justify">Figure 8.  Results from the %RIS analysis.  The number of isolates tested for each antimicrobial is indicated to the left, while the percent of isolates resistant to each antimicrobial is depicted to the right.</p>


                                    <p align="justify">Now click on some of the antimicrobials listed in the lower panel, for example ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  WHONET will display the zone diameter or MIC distribution of the selected drug.  The red lines in the graph represent the interpretative breakpoints.  For disk diffusion results, susceptible bacteria will appear to the right of the red lines; resistant isolates are to the left; and intermediate results are between the two lines.  For MIC data, the susceptible bacteria will appear to the left and resistant bacteria to the right.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/dta-1/figure-9.jpg" alt="Figure 3.  Running the analysis" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">    

                                    <p align="justify">Figure 9.  Zone diameter histograms for ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for E. coli isolates.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">For most antimicrobials and organisms, the susceptible bacteria should form a fairly “normal” Gaussian distribution.  You can see this for the E. coli histograms, even for those antibiotics with very few test results.  Deviations from this pattern are common for some organisms and antimicrobials, but can also suggest test problems in laboratory practices –  for example poor reagent quality (disks or test medium), inoculum preparation, or result measurement (for example number preference).</p>

                                    <p align="justify">The ampicillin histogram suggests three principal bacterial subpopulations:  1. the wild-type susceptible population with large zone diameters; 2. a group with high-level resistance to ampicillin (zone diameter = 6mm = no inhibition); and 3. a group with low-level resistance (zone diameters 11 and 12mm).  The latter two groups presumably possess different resistance genes – an observation not only useful for molecular research, but also in the investigation and characterization of outbreak-associated strains.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">The second histogram depicts results for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and illustrates two distint populations that lie in the susceptible category:  one population with the “wild-type” phenotype with relatively large zone diameters and a second population with “decreased susceptibility” with diminished zone diameters.</p>

                                    The WHONET results that you see on the screen can easily be transferred to other softwares such as Microsoft Excel, Word, or PowerPoint.  You can do this either by using “Copy” and “Paste” or by saving the results as a file.<br />

                                    Copy and Paste:  Click on “Copy table”.  Now open Microsoft Excel, for example by clicking on your Windows “Start”, “All Programs” menus and looking for Microsoft Excel.  (Alternatively, if you want to immediately go to your Windows Desktop, click on the “Windows” key on your keyboard and hit the letter D, in other words “Windows”-D.)<br />

                                    After you have Excel open, go to “Edit”, “Paste”.  The WHONET results are now in Excel.  You can now use Excel to edit, correct, format, or graph your results.<br />

                                    Now return to WHONET (for example, by clicking on the WHONET icon on the bottom of your screen).  Click on “Copy graph”.  Go back to Excel, find an empty part of the spreadsheet, and again choose “Edit”, “Paste”.<br />

                                  <p align="justify">Save the file:  WHONET also has an option for saving the results directly to a file.  Because “Copy” and “Paste” works well and is usually very fast, there is often no need to do this, but there are a few situations where saving the results as a table can be useful.  1. For “isolate listings” or “resistance profile listings” with thousands of rows, the “Copy” and “Paste” approach can be very slow.  In this case, saving the results as an Excel or as a text file would be much faster.  2. When you save the table as an Excel file, WHONET does some automatic formatting of the results and automatically makes a number of Excel graphs.  So by using the “Save table” option, this may save you some time formatting the data in Excel.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">To save the tables and graphs as an Excel file, click on “File”.  Give a name to the file, for example “S. aureus RIS results.xls”.  For type of file, select “Excel”.  Notice that the default location for this file is c:\whonet5\output.  Then click ‘OK’.  </p>

                                  Another useful feature of WHONET is the creation of lists of isolates or patients that meet certain criteria – for example a lists of patients with MRSA or positive blood cultures from the neonatal intensive care unit.  WHONET can create such lists as well as summarize the results in a number of different ways.<br />

                                  Click on “Analysis type”, and select “Isolate listing and summary”.  For the summary, by default WHONET will use the variable “Organism” for the rows and “Specimen date” by month for the columns. <br />

                                  For this tutorial, make one small change to the options.  Next to specimen date appears the option “Month”.  Because there is only one month of data to analyze in this tutorial, it will be more interesting to show the results by day or by week.  Select the option “Day”.  Leave the other options unchanged, and click “OK”.  Click on “Begin analysis”.  In this example, WHONET will show you a list of all isolates from the data set with Enterobacteriaceae, as below.

To do so, you would have to go back to laboratory configuration “Modify laboratory”, “Data fields”.  For the data fields that you want to appear in the list, make sure that the box for “Isolate listing” is checked.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">If you click on the box “Show hidden columns”, WHONET will show you all of the available fields.  As in other parts of WHONET, you can click on a column heading to sort the database by that column.  This could be useful, for example, to find errors in the entry of specimen dates.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">When you finish looking at the isolate listing, select “Continue”.  WHONET will proceed to display the summary of the isolate listing.  As mentioned earlier, this summary is comparing “Organism” and “Specimen date” (by day).  But by changing the analysis parameters, you can summarize any WHONET variable by any other variable.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">The tables present the day-by-day trend (number of patients per day) in the isolation of each species, while the graph displays the same information in graphic format.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the preceding analysis, WHONET included results from all S. aureus isolates in the analysis (except for laboratory and quality control isolates).  For some analyses, such as isolate listings, including results from all isolates is appropriate.<br/>

                                    However, for calculations of %Resistant or %Susceptible, it is usually recommended to make an adjustment to account for the fact that some patients have multiple culture results for the analyzed species.  Patients who remain a long time in the hospital or patients with complicated clinical courses may have multiple isolates of the species in question, but outpatients and patients with simple clinical histories may only have a single isolation.  If no adjustment is made to the calculation, the statistics will be biased towards the results of the patients with multiple isolates, frequently a subset with higher rates of resistance than other patients.<br/>

                                    The U.S. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has published a document “M39 – Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Statistics”, and this document recommends that laboratories use the first isolate per species for the analyzed time period when calculating susceptibility and resistance proportions for purposes of developing guidelines for empiric therapy.<br/>

                                    WHONET offers several strategies for handling multiple patient isolates, including the CLSI recommendation of “first isolate per patient”.  To see these options, click on “One-per-patient”.  At the top of the screen, choose “By patient”.  Then choose “First isolate only”. <br/> 

                                    </p>

                                  <p align="justify">Click “OK”, and then “Begin analysis” to get the following results.  You will notice now that WHONET is displaying results of 57 patients with S. aureus tested for oxacillin, and 14.0% of the first isolates were resistant to oxacillin (In most analyses of hospital pathogens, the “by isolate” approach wield yield a higher estimate of %resistance than the “by patient” approaches, but at this example demonstrates, this is not always the case.)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">There are a few other options on this screen that you should leave unchanged for this tutorial:</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Exclude laboratory samples:  To avoid mixing clinical from non-clinical isolates in your institution’s summary statistics, WHONET by default does not include the isolates in which the specimen type is equal to “qc” (quality control), “la” (laboratory sample), or “ex” (external quality control) or if the department is equal to “lab”.  If you would like to include these results in your analyses, remove the check in this box.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Include isolates that satisfy all of the selection criteria / Include isolates that satisfy at least one of the selection criteria:  If you choose the first of these options, WHONET will search for isolates that meet all of the selection criteria.  In this example, WHONET will find results in which the isolate is from blood and is also resistant to oxacillin.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">If you choose the second option, WHONET will search for isolates that meet at least one of the criteria.  This would not be very useful in this example, but a more interesting example would be to ask for Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to cefotaxime or to ceftazidime (or to both agents).</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Delete this criteria / Delete all criteria.  If you select these options, you can remove the selection criteria that you have selected.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">After selecting the criteria “Specimen type = Blood” and “Erythromycin= Resistant”, click on “OK” to return to the main analysis screen.  (Generally, it would be more interesting to study oxacillin-resistant strains than erythromycin-resistant ones, but in this small data set, there were no blood isolates of MRSA isolates.)</p>

                                  <p align="justify">In Data Analysis 1, you saw how to do isolate listings, summaries, and %RIS statistics.  In this section, you will see how to compare the results of two antibiotic tests to each other.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Click on “Analysis type”, and select “Scatterplot”.  In the lower part of the screen, you will select to antibiotic tests to compare.  For the first example, put the Penicillin-Disk test on the X axis and the Oxacillin-Disk test on the Y axis.  Then click “OK” and “Begin analysis” to get the following graph.</p> 

                                  <img src="whonet/dta-2/figure-10.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  Scatterplots" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 
                                   

                                  <p align="justify">This graph shows the zone diameter distribution of isolates tested against both penicillin and oxacillin.  Numbers in the figure represent percentage of isolates, and the red lines indicate the interpretative breakpoints.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">For example, in the upper right-hand corner of the graph, there are a number of isolates with large zone diameters for penicillin (≥30mm) and large zone diameters for oxacillin (≥13mm).  These isolates are susceptible to both agents – this is the traditional wild-type phenotype for S. aureus.  The lower left-hand quadrant represents isolates resistant to both drugs; these would be the MRSA isolates.  The greatest number of isolates is in the upper left-hand section of the graph.  Such isolates are resistant to penicillin (to the left of the red line), but susceptible to oxacillin (above the red line).  This is the classical phenotype for beta-lactamase (penicillinase) producing S. aureus. </p> 

                                  <p align="justify">Fortunately, there are no isolates in the lower right-hand quadrant.  Such isolates would have the phenotype penicillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant.  Microbiologically, such results would be exceedingly rare, and most likely attributable to an error in the laboratory (poor quality reagents, test performance, measurement, transcription, etc.) </p> 

                                  <p align="justify">Thus a scatterplot can be useful both in the description of molecular mechanisms of resistance, as well as in the detection of unusual or impossible phenotypes suggestive of possible errors.  Click on “Continue” to return to the main data analysis screen.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">To obtain the scatterplot that you just reviewed, you will need quantitative data (zone diameters and/or MIC values).  If you do not have these measurements, you can still do a this kind of comparison, but using the test interpretations rather than the measurements.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Click on “Analysis type”.  In the middle of the screen, the current select is “Test measurements”.  Click on “Test interpretations”.  Click on “OK” and “Begin analysis”.  </p>
                                  <img src="whonet/dta-2/figure-11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.  Scatterplots" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 

                                  <p align="justify">In this output, you see the same kind of results seen in the quantitative scatterplot, but using the R, I, S categories.  You will again observe the three major subtypes of S. aureus in this chart.  21.2% of the isolates have the wild-type phenotype (PEN-S, OXA-S), 68.2% have the penicillinase-producer phenotype (PEN-R, OXA-S), and 10.6% have the MRSA phenotype (PEN-R, OXA-R).  Click on “Continue” to return to the data analysis screen.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Click on “Analysis type”, and choose the following scatterplot options:  X-Axis = Oxacillin-Disk and Y-Axis = Ciprofloxacin Disk.  Do this scatterplot both by Test measurements and by Test interpretation to get the following two graphs.</p>
                                  <img src="whonet/dta-2/figure-12.jpg" alt="Figure 3.  Scatterplots" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">    
                                    
                                  <p align="justify">In the previous example, the two drugs selected (penicillin and oxacillin) were from the same class of drugs (beta-lactams).  Such a comparison is useful for studying mechanisms of resistance and quality assurance (finding unlikely resistance phenotypes).  In this example, the antibiotics oxacillin and ciprofloxacin are from two different classes of drugs with distinct mechanisms of resistance, so the graphs give information about cross-resistance and genetic linkages between classes.  For example, in this case you see that most MRSA isolates (oxacillin-resistant) are also resistant to ciprofloxacin, a commonly observed epidemiological finding in many institutions.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Besides their value in studies of molecular epidemiology, studies of cross-resistance are useful to pharmacists and clinicians in developing policies for first-line and second-line treatment alternatives and to infection control staff in describing distinct clones causing hospital-acquired infections.</p>

                                  The final analysis that covered in this tutorial is the study of multi-resistance patterns using the analysis “Resistance profiles”.  Click on “Analysis type”, and select “Resistant profiles”.  Because you are analyzing only one month of data, change the option “Month” in the middle of the screen to “Day”.

                                  </p>

                                  <p align="justify">Then “OK” and “Begin analysis”.  The following isolate listing shows the bottom portion of the output.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">This listing is very similar to the one you did in Data analysis 1 with the analysis option “Isolate listing and summary”.  But there are two additional columns:  “Profile” (using one-letter antibiotic codes) and “Resistance profile” (using three-letter antibiotic codes).  These columns indicate the multi-resistance pattern of the isolates.  The profiles indicate the drugs to which the isolate is either resistant or intermediate (i.e. non-susceptible).  For example “PE” = “PEN ERY” = isolates non-susceptible to penicillin and erythromycin, but susceptible to the other drugs requested.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Completely susceptible isolates appear at the top of the listing, followed by isolates non-susceptible to one drug, then to two drugs, etc.  Multi-resistant strains appear at the bottom of the listing.  This analysis thus categorizes all of the observed isolates according to resistance phenotype.  If a patient has multiple isolates, you can see whether the isolates have the same resistance phenotype, or whether the phenotype changes over time, for example accumulating mutations, resistance genes, and plasmids.  By examining the dates and the room numbers, you may also detect possible outbreaks of certain strains of S. aureus as defined by their multi-resistance pattern.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Click on “Continue” to see a summary of this list.

                                  <p align="justify">This output summarizes findings for all resistance phenotypes observed in the database.  In this sample database, you will see that the most common phenotype is pan-susceptible (susceptible to all drugs requested) followed by “PEN” (non-susceptible to penicillin).  Among MRSA isolates, the most common phenotype is “PEN OXA ERY CLI GEN SXT CIP”, in other words non-susceptible to all drugs requested with the exception of vancomycin.  The day-by-day distribution of this MRSA phenotype is shown in the graph.</p>

                                    WHONET now permits the user to take advantage of pre-defined or user-defined expert rules that can benefit the user in data entry and in clinical reporting.  An additional unique feature of the WHONET expert system is the integrated use of expert rules in data analysis. <br />

                                    At present, WHONET 5.4 includes approximately 200 microbiological rules.  In this first version of the expert system, pre-defined expert rules cannot be edited, but individual rules can be turned on or off by the user.  In addition, users are also free to develop their own expert rules for reporting and analysis. <br />
                                    </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Rules are flagged according to the following alert categories.</p>
                                        - Quality assurance<br />

                                    <h3><strong>1A. Configuration of microbiological alerts</strong></h3>

                                    <p align="justify">Begin WHONET, select your laboratory, and click on “Modify Laboratory”.  You will see a new button on the screen for “Alerts”.  Click on this button, and you will see the following screen.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">                   


                                    <h4><strong>Predefined alerts</strong></h4>

                                    <p align="justify">In the example, a rule for Enterobacteriaceae non-susceptible to carbapenems has been selected.  Details of the rule appear below.  The software customizes the rules depending on the antimicrobials which you test in your laboratory.  You can click on “Active rule” to activate or deactivate the rule.  At the top of the screen, you can decide whether you want to view all rules, or only rules of a particular type, for example Quality control rules.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">There is also a button called “Select pre-defined alerts”.  At present, there is only one set of expert rules defined in WHONET, but it is anticipated that in the future, some countries or projects may wish to create their own pre-defined sets for use in the surveillance network.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>User-defined alerts</strong></h4>
                                    

                                    <p align="justify">Click on “New”, and a screen similar to the following will appear.  To define a rule, first give a name to the rule, for example “S. aureus and spa typing”.  You can indicate whether this is a high, medium, or low priority rule.  In the area “Define the selection criteria”, use the “Organisms” and “Isolates” buttons in the same way that you would in WHONET data analysis to select the organism/isolate criteria for the alert.</p>


                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-2.jpg" alt="Figure 2.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">  


                                    <p align="justify">Now that you have defined the criteria which will trigger the alert, you can indicate that details of the alert back to the user.  Use “Alerts” to indicate that category and type of alert, and select “Messages” to enter any messages you wish to display back to the microbiologist or to the clinician.  If you click “Alert”, you will get the following screen:</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 
                                     

                                    <p align="justify">Indicate the flags which you wish to apply to the new alert, and click “OK”. <br />

                                    If you click on “Messages”, you will get the following.  Indicate any messages you wish to send to the microbiologist or clinician, and click “OK”.  When you complete all details of your new alert, you can return to the main configuration screen to save your modifications. </p>

                                     
                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-4.jpg" alt="Figure 4.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 
                                     
                                    <h3><strong>1B. Alerts and Data entry</strong></h3>
                                    

                                    <p align="justify">Alerts are a significant enhancement to the data entry program.  They can assist in the identification of typing errors, prompt notification of resistance results, and educational information on recommended laboratory testing practices.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Go to the Data Entry program, and process with normal entry of information.  As you begin to enter results, any alerts triggered will appear automatically in the lower right-hand corner of the screen, as in the figure below.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-5.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 


                                    <p align="justify">If there is a “High priority” alert, you will receive an alert similar to the following.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-6.jpg" alt="Figure 6.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 


                                    <p align="justify">When you save the isolate, you will get a summary of all of the alert messages.</p>

                                     
                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-7.jpg" alt="Figure 7.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">

                                    <h3><strong>1C. Alerts and Data analysis</strong></h3>
                                    

                                    <p align="justify">One of the powerful features of the expert system is the integration of microbiological alerts into analysis tools.  This will facilitate a quick review of large amounts of data, highlighting possible laboratory errors or important resistance findings.  For national data managers, this feature can facilitate the prompt feedback to laboratory participants and further identification of problems identified.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In Data Analysis, microbiological alerts are integrated into a two main areas:  1. isolate listings and 2. BacTrack – Isolate alerts.  To test out the new features, you may use the WHO Test Hospital sample database or your own.  The following screens were prepared with the WHO Test Hospital data.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Isolate listings:  Go to Data Analysis, and choose “Analysis Type”.  Click on “Isolate listing and summary”.  Click on the new option:  “Include isolate alerts”.  </p>
                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-8.jpg" alt="Figure  8.Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">
                                     

                                    <p align="justify">Click on “Alerts” to see additional options.  As you can see in the below screen, you can include all alerts in the analysis, or only certain categories of alerts of interest to you.  By default, WHONET will include all High and Medium priority isolate alerts from all alert types.  Indicate the alerts that you want included in your analysis.  Then click “OK”, and then “OK” again to return to the main analysis screen.</p>

                                     
                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-9.jpg" alt="Figure 9.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">

                                    <p align="justify">For “Organisms”, select “ALL” organisms.  For “Data files”, select “w0195who.tst”.  Then “Begin analysis”.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">The left portion of the screen will look like the below.  This is unchanged from earlier versions of WHONET.  WHONET will display test interpretations for this analysis rather than zone diameters of MIC values.</p>
                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-10.jpg" alt="Figure 10.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">
                                     

                                    <p align="justify">The right portion of the screen looks like the following.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-11.jpg" alt="Figure 11.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 

                                    <p align="justify">The usual line-listing from earlier versions of WHONET has now been supplemented with microbiological comments about potentially incorrect or important results.  By clicking on any column heaing, the results table can be sorted by that column.  In this way, it would be easy to see a list of isolates that should perhaps be repeated and sent to a reference laboratory if necessary.</p>


                                    <h3><strong>BacTrack – Isolate alerts</strong></h3>

                                    <p align="justify">In the isolate listing and summary, this user view results from all isolates, many of which may have alert comments.  In the “Isolate alerts” feature, only strains with alerts are presented to the user.  Alerts include a combination of microbiological rules, as described above, as well as statistical alerts for isolates occurring in low frequency according to the historical data of that laboratory.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">To take advantage of the statistical “low frequency” alerts, you should first create a BacTrack reference dictionary with historical data from this laboratory – for example, the 2005 data file.  You will then compare your new data file against this historical data.  Alternatively, you could create the BacTrack dictionary using the new data file.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">For this example, choose “BacTrack – Isolate alerts” and “Create dictionary”.  Then click “OK”.  For Organisms, WHONET will automatically include “ALL” isolates.  For data files, select “w0195who.tst”.  Then “Begin Analysis”.  When the analysis is finished, you will receive a message “BacTrack has completed the dictionary.”</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/expert-system/se-figure-12.jpg" alt="Figure 12.  Isolate alerts" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">
                                     

                                    <p align="justify">Now return to “Analysis Type” and select “BacTrack – Isolate alerts”, “Isolate alerts”.  As earlier, you can click on “Alerts” to select those alerts you would like included in the analysis.  You may also set the percent of isolates to be used as a threshold for the determination of “infrequent” results.  The default is 5% for each option.  To increase the number of flagged isolates, you can increase this percentage.  To decrease the number of flagged isolates, then lower the percentage.  You can put the percentage at 0% if you want to turn a particular feature off.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Every isolate included in this printout has at least one alert flag.  Statistical “low frequency alerts” are found to the left of the listing, and are marked by a special symbol:  1. “*” – the observed resistance is infrequent, based on the hospital’s local data; 2. “#” – the observed susceptible result is infrequent, based on the hospitals’ data; and 3. “+” – the antibiotic indicated is not frequently tested for this organism, based on the hospital’s data.<br />

                                    In this particular example, examples of “infrequent” results include:  E. coli resistant to gentamicin; Enterococcus spp. susceptible to clindamycin; H. influenzae resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; P. aeruginosa resistant to amikacin; P. aeruginosa resistant to tobramycin; and P. mirabilis resistant to ampicillin.  While such findings may be common in other institutions, the alerts indicate that these findings are rare (<5%) for the results of organisms in this laboratory.  Findings of low frequency may perhaps be due to laboratory error, so should be confirmed; or they may reflect important new resistant strains still present at low levels in the institution.<br />

                                    In contrast to the fixed, pre-defined, globally relevant microbiological expert rules described earlier, a great advantage of the “low frequency” alerts is that alerts are automatically adjusted to the past experience of this particular laboratory for all tested organisms and antibiotics.<br />

                                    After viewing the isolate alert listing, click “Continue” to proceed to the isolate alert summary.  The summary tabulates every alert that was encountered in the scanned data.  Totals are provided, as well as the type of alert – “quality assurance”, “send to a reference laboratory”, etc.  If results from more than one laboratory are scanned, the summary also includes the breakdown of alerts by laboratory, as illustrated in the screen below.</p>

In WHONET, a Macro is a small file which remembers the details of one of your analysis requests, and a Report is a collection of multiple macros.  Reports can be viewed on the screen, but are more usefully saved as formatted Excel files for later viewing.</p>

                            <p align="justify">For someone who knows WHONET well, macros and reports can be a significant time saver.  For users new to WHONET or to microbiology, the use of WHONET standard reports or locally prepared reports is learned easily, and provides access to focused, important information with minimal effort.</p>

                            <p align="justify">In addition to their value in interactive WHONET use, Macros and Reports can be used to automate analyses or to integrate WHONET into an internet page or other development package.

                                      The value of macros and reports has been significantly enhanced through improvements in the formatting of Excel files prepared by WHONET.  To see these modifications, load up the macro created in Part 1 and run the analysis.  You will see the following screen for E. coli.</p>

The intent is to provide much of the benefit of the WHONET interactive analysis program, but with minimal time and effort.  Users can choose from a few Standard Reports offered by WHONET or they may create their own reports for use within the laboratory or by clinical services in other hospital areas, such as infection control or pharmacy.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">For this example, begin WHONET, open the “WHO Test Hospital”, go to “Analysis” and select “Quick Analysis”.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">WHONET will perform multiple analyses on the selected data file(s), and prepare a multi-part overview of key results.  A few of the sections are depicted below.  (Note:  The formatting and presentation of the standard report on the screen has not been optimized.  This will be completed in the near future.)</p>

In this part, the creation of a new report format by the user is described.  To take advantage of this option, you will need to create one or macros, as described earlier in Part 1.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the Quick Analysis screen, click on “New”.  Give a name to the new report, for example “Weekly infection control report”.  On the left side of the screen, you will see the macros that you created earlier in Part 1.  Select these macros over to the right side of the screen.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">A report typically consists of multiple macros, but a report can also include other reports.  In this way, you can build up more complete reports from smaller subreports. </p>

                                    <p align="justify">After you have selected the macros and reports to include in this report, click on Save.  By default the name of this file will be “Weekly infection control report.rpt”, and the file will be saved in c:\whonet5\macros.  After you save the report file, click on “Exit” to return to the main Quick Analysis screen.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Choose the new report that you have just created.  Choose the w0195who.tst data file.  Change the “Output” destination to “Excel”.  WHONET will give the default name:  “C:\whonet5\Output\Weekly infection control report-2006-06-02.xls” to the file, i.e. the name of the report plus the date of creation.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Begin the analysis.  When the analysis is completed you will be asked if you want to view the new Excel file.  Click “Yes”.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">WHONET will now open Excel.  If it does not pop up on the screen in front of you, check the list of open programs at the bottom of the screen to see if Excel is open.  If so, click on Excel to see your results file.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Below is a portion of the Excel report created by WHONET.  You will notice that the file has four worksheets.

                                  <p align="justify">With the use of macros and reports, WHONET analyses can be accessed from the Windows command line, Windows Task Scheduler, other softwares developed by programmers involved in public health surveillance, or Internet pages.  The syntax is simple.  Simply write the name of the macro or report after the program name – whonet.exe.  An example of a command to automatically call WHONET using one of the above macros would be:        c:\whonet5\whonet.exe “eco and sau RIS results.mcr”</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Note – if the macro name includes spaces, you must enclose the macro name in quotation marks.  If the macro is in the default macros folder (usually c:\whonet5\macros), then you do not need to indicate the macros location.  Otherwise, you should include it in the command.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">The Windows Task Scheduler
                                  The Window Task Scheduler is a standard feature in Windows computers, and is often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as virus checking or software backups.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Note:  In the absence an automated BacLink download, a scheduled WHONET analysis will be of little benefit for most users.  In the future, as automated BacLink setups become more common, then automated analyses with WHONET and automatic e-mailing of reports to relevant hospital staff will become much more valuable.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">You can access the “Task Scheduler” either from the Windows Control Panel or from “All Programs”, “Accessories”, “System Tools”, “Scheduled Tasks”.  Click on “Add Scheduled Task”.  From the list of softwares on your computer, select WHONET 5.4.  </p>

                                  <p align="justify">Indicate the desired scheduling, for example “Weekly” or “One time only”.  The below example sets up an automated analysis every Monday morning at 6am.  Click Next.  If requested, provide your Windows password.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">You are not quite finished yet.  If you click “Finish” now, WHONET will run at 6am on Monday, but it will simply open and not perform any analyses.  We need to tell the system which macro or report we want WHONET to run.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">To do this, click on the box labeled “Open advanced properties for the task when I click Finish”.  After putting a checkbox there, click on Finish to proceed to the advanced properties.  Under “Run”, the system will just have “c:\whonet5\whonet.exe”.  To this you need to add the name of your macro or report, for example “eco and sau RIS results.mcr” in the below screen.  Click OK to finalize the task.</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Calling WHONET from another program</p>

                                  <p align="justify">Here is an example from an early version of the new ABC Calc software under development at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen.  The focus of ABC Calc is the management of antimicrobial consumption data, but ABC Calc will also have an integration tool allowing for the simultaneous analysis, presentation, and correlation of antimicrobial resistance data (from WHONET) and consumption data (from ABC Calc).</p>

                                  <p align="justify">In the below screen, the user selects their analysis options from an interface similar to WHONET.  When the user clicks on “Load WHONET data”, ABC Calc prepares a WHONET macro with the user selections, which it sends to WHONET for analysis.  WHONET runs the analysis, and saves the results in a simple text file.  ABC Calc waits for WHONET to finish and then reads and displays the text file back to the user, for example on a graph which also displays antimicrobial consumption statistics.</p>

                        <p align="justify"> For many years, WHONET has had the ability to present temporal trends in organism frequencies and resistance proportions in the form of descriptive statistics and graphs.  The user could then examine these trends and graphs individually in efforts to detect and characterize possible community or hospital outbreaks of microorganisms.  WHONET was not able to highlight potential clusters in an automatic fashion in order to focus the attention of the software user on possible outbreaks or to provide statistical guidance as to whether observed trends were statistically significant.  </p>

                        <p align="justify">To facilitate the early and broad detection of possible outbreaks, we have integrated a powerful freeware tool developed for purposes of cluster detection in public health data.
                        SaTScan™, a trademark of Martin Kulldorf, was developed under the joint auspices of Martin Kulldorf, of the National Cancer Institute and of Farzad Mostarashi at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  Dr. Kulldorf is an Associate Professor and Biostatistician at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Department of Ambulatory Care and Prevention, Boston, USA.</p>

                        <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 30px"><i>Kulldorf M. and Information Management Services, Inc. SaTScan™ v.7.0:  Software for the spatial and time-scan statistics.  http://www.satscan.org, 2006.</i></p>

                        <p align="justify">The software permits a number of algorithms for the detection of event clusters.  Options include retrospective or prospective cluster detection; purely temporal, pure spatial, or space-time clusters; and flexible parameter selection for space and time variables.  In this first version of an integrated WHONET-SaTScan package, WHONET is using a space-time permutation probability model, using Monte Carlo simulations.  In collaboration with Dr. Kulldorf in a five-year NIH project entitled “Modeling Infectious Disease Agent Study” (MIDAS), we will test out a number of additional algorithms, models, and parameters, and these optimized routines will eventually be offered through the WHONET user interface.</p>

                        <p align="justify">In WHONET 5.4, SaTScan statistics have been integrated into two standard analysis features:  1. Isolate listing summaries and 2. Resistance profile summaries.  Two new analysis options specific to SaTScan have also been added:  1. SaTScan – Cluster detection in Data Analysis and 2. SaTScan – Space-and-Time cluster detection in Quick Analysis.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Open the WHO Test Hospital, and go to Data Analysis.  Go to Analysis Type, and select Isolate listing and summary.  At the bottom of the screen, click on the option “Include SaTScan alerts”.  By doing this, the SaTScan statistics will be integrated directly into the standard Isolate Listing Summary output.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/cluster/cluster-figure-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  SaTScan and Isolate listing summaries" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">
    


                                    <p align="justify">Note:  In the above example, the column variable has been set to “Specimen date” by “Day”.  In most cases, you should probably leave this option set to “Month” or “Week”.  But for purposes of this tutorial, we have set the option to “Day” because the sample dataset only includes one month of data.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">To see the details of the SaTScan analysis, click on “SaTScan” to see the below screen. </p> 

                                    <img src="whonet/cluster/cluster-figure-2.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  SaTScan and Isolate listing summaries" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">
                                     

                                    <p align="justify">On this screen, you will see a small minority of all of the parameter options available in SaTScan.  The use of SaTScan to study microbiological laboratory data and hospital infections data is very new, and will be a major focus of the 5-year NIH grant.  As we gain more experience with the use of SaTScan for microbiology data, the number of options included in WHONET will increased and the suggested default parameter values will change to reflect optimal use of the program by microbiologists, infection control, and clinical staff.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the above example, the user has access to two SaTScan variables.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Analysis type:  Retrospective vs. Prospective.  Retrospective analysis looks for infectious disease clusters at any time during the data analysis time period – both old clusters and new clusters.  This option would be very useful in a retrospective look at available data for any possible outbreak.  Prospective analysis only looks for clusters that potentially are still ongoing.  This option is appropriate for the prospective detection of outbreaks in the new data.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Maximum cluster length:  Indicate the number of days for the greatest length of a possible outbreak.  At present, the default is set to 15 days.  In other words, SaTScan will look for clusters that are anywhere from 1 day to 15 days in length.  If an outbreak is longer than this period, SaTScan possibly may not detect it or possibly may detect only part of it.  To find the greatest possible number of potential clusters, you can put a large value for the Maximum cluster length.  A long period can slow SaTScan down considerably, so you can experiment to see what impact this value has on 1) the number of detected clusters and 2) the time period needed for the analysis.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">Note:  In SaTScan, the largest possible value of the Maximum cluster length is half the analysis time period.  For example, if you have one year (365 days) of data to scan, the largest value that SaTScan will accept is 182 days.  It is not a problem if you enter a higher value into WHONET.  WHONET will dynamically adjust the value before it sends the analysis parameters to SaTScan.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Location options:  In WHONET so far, we are not yet taking advantage of SaTScan’s ability to handle geographic data.  For outpatients, such variables could include zip code or street address GPS latitude and longitude.  For inpatients, it is possible describe to SaTScan the geographic (hospital physical location) or functional (clinical care service) relationship between patient care units.  So at the present time, WHONET does an automatic configuration of patient locations, treating each ward as a separate “island” of care, unconnected to any other wards.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">In the future, it will be possible for WHONET users to describe the ward structure of hospital units in a SaTScan “coordinate file” in a simple user interface.  If a user does take the time to describe the geography of their hospital to WHONET, this option will permit the user to select the coordinated file created.</p>


                                    <p align="justify">After you select the desired features, click “OK” to return to the main analysis screen.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Then click on “One per patient”.  Select the options “By patient”, “First isolate only”.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p align="justify">Note:  It would be probably more useful for cluster detection to put the option “By time interval or resistance phenotype”, for example with a 30 day window between isolates.  This option does exist for %RIS calculation, but unfortunately, this option is not yet ready for other analyses, such as isolate listings and resistance profiles.  This will be addressed in the near future.</p>

                                     <img src="whonet/cluster/cluster-figure-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3.  SaTScan and Isolate listing summaries" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">

                                    <p align="justify">Note:  We do not yet know what criteria would be most effective in detecting real infectious disease outbreaks, and whether the criteria should differ for different organisms.  SaTScan does an excellent job of finding statistically defined “clusters” of events, but the clinical interpretation of these clusters will depend on the experience and insight of infection control and clinical staff.  With more testing on real datasets, we will aim to provide tested and validated recommendations for setting the cluster detection parameters. </p> 

                                    <p align="justify">Finally, click “OK” and Begin Analysis.  First you will see the standard isolate listing.  (SaTScan makes no changes to the isolate listing.  If you do not wish to see the listing, you should choose “Summary” as the Report format rather than “Both”.)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">When you click Begin Analysis, WHONET will read the data files, and prepare the files needed by SaTScan to operate.  WHONET will then send this information to SaTScan.  A small icon will appear at the bottom of the screen to tell you that SaTScan is running in the background.  When SaTScan is finished, this icon will disappear automatically.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">After SaTScan is finished analyzing the data, WHONET will read the SaTScan results, and integrate the statistics into the normal WHONET output, as in the below screen.  </p>

                                    <img src="whonet/cluster/cluster-figure-4.jpg" alt="Figure 4.  SaTScan and Isolate listing summaries" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 

                                    <p align="justify">In addition to the typical columns for Isolate listing summaries, you see several additional columns in this output related to the clusters detected by SaTScan.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">In the sample dataset with one month of data, WHONET found 39 bacterial species.  SaTScan identified possible clusters in 7 of these species.  Cluster number 1 is the cluster of greatest statistical significance (smallest p-value), etc.  Only one of the identified clusters has a small p-value:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Organism      Klebsiella pneumoniae</li>
                                        <li>Cluster dates   January 28-30</li>
                                        <li>Observed      8 patients</li>
                                        <li>Expected      1.75 patients</li>
                                        <li>p-value     0.065 </li>
                                    </ul>    


                                    <p align="justify">This particular organism is depicted in the below graph, confirming that there does indeed seem to be a rise in the number of patients with K. pneumoniae at the end of the month.</p>

In this section, we will see how the same statistics can be applied to resistance profile data.  For the output columns, put “Specimen date” by “Day”.  (As above, we are selecting “Day” in this tutorial because there is only one month of data.)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Go to “Analysis Type”, and select “Resistance profiles”.  Check on the box for “Include SaTScan alerts”.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">For “One per patient”, put “By patient”, “First isolate only”.  For “Organisms”, select S. aureus.  Then begin the analysis.  WHONET will first show you the Resistance profile listing.  This is not affected by the SaTScan analysis.  Hit Continue to proceed to the Resistance profile summary.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/cluster/cluster-figure-6.jpg" alt="Figure 1.  SaTScan and Resistance profile summaries" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position "> 

                                    <p align="justify">WHONET found 60 isolates of S. aureus, which cluster into 16 different resistance phenotypes.  (The results “-” and “---” indicated that the indicated antimicrobials were not tested).  From the 16 resistance phenotypes, SaTScan identified 4 possible clusters.  Cluster number 1 has the following characteristics.</p>
                                      <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <li>Resistance profile  PEN      </li>  
                                        <li>CIP    (non-susceptible only to PEN and CIP)</li>
                                        <li>Cluster dates     January 29-30</li>
                                        <li>Observed        2 patients</li>
                                        <li>Expected        0.21 patients</li>

                                      </ul>  

                                    <p align="justify">The graph for this resistance profile is given above.  Even though the number of isolates is very small, and the p-value is not, this cluster may still be of interest.  In the entire month of January, this resistance profile was only seen three times, all at the end of month – once on January 26 (not detected by SaTScan), January 29, and January 30.  In a further investigation, it would be useful to look at the patient locations.  If you refer back to the Resistance profile listing, you will notice that the three isolates came respectively from location “xx = Unknown”, “er = Emergency Room”, and “op = Outpatient”.  So there is no epidemiologic link between these three patients with the available data, but one possibly would be revealed with further investigation of the patient medical records.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">In Part 1, we saw that January had 39 bacterial species.  Of the 39 species, SaTScan has identified 18 possible “ongoing” clusters, in other words clusters that potentially could include January 31, the final date of the analysis period.  Of the 18 clusters, only one has a small p-value</p>

In other words, the results from each species will be summarized in a separate row row in the output.</p>  

                                    <p align="justify">Click on “OK” in the bottom right to select the options.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Click on “Begin analysis”. If you wish, you can then copy and paste these results to Excel for further editing of the results for distribution to clinical staff.

                                    <p align="justify">The WHONET results that you see on the screen can easily be transferred to other softwares such as Microsoft Excel, Word, or PowerPoint.  You can do this either by using “Copy” and “Paste” or by saving the results as a file.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Copy and Paste:  Click on “Copy table”.  Now open Microsoft Excel, for example by clicking on your Windows “Start”, “All Programs” menus and looking for Microsoft Excel.  (Alternatively, if you want to immediately go to your Windows Desktop, click on the “Windows” key on your keyboard and hit the letter D, in other words “Windows”-D.)</p>

                                    <p align="justify">After you have Excel open, go to “Edit”, “Paste”.  The WHONET results are now in Excel.  You can now use Excel to edit, correct, format, or graph your results.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Now return to WHONET (for example, by clicking on the WHONET icon on the bottom of your screen).  Click on “Copy graph”.  Go back to Excel, find an empty part of the spreadsheet, and again choose “Edit”, “Paste”.</p>

                                    <img src="whonet/run-antibio/run-antibio-f9.jpg" alt="Figure 9. How to run Antibiogram" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-position ">

                                    <p align="justify">Save the file:  WHONET also has an option for saving the results directly to a file.  Because “Copy” and “Paste” works well and is usually very fast, there is often no need to do this, but there are a few situations where saving the results as a table can be useful.  1. For “isolate listings” or “resistance profile listings” with thousands of rows, the “Copy” and “Paste” approach can be very slow.  In this case, saving the results as an Excel or as a text file would be much faster.  2. When you save the table as an Excel file, WHONET does some automatic formatting of the results and automatically makes a number of Excel graphs.  So by using the “Save table” option, this may save you some time formatting the data in Excel.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">To save the tables and graphs as an Excel file, click on “File”.  Give a name to the file, for example “S. aureus RIS results.xls”.  For type of file, select “Excel”.  Notice that the default location for this file is c:\whonet5\output.  Then click ‘OK’.  </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Figure 11.  Saving results from WHONET to an Excel file.</p>


                                    <p align="justify">Now go back to Excel and select “File”, “Open”.  Look in the folder c:\whonet5\output for the file that you just created, and open it up.  You will see something the following.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Figure 12.  A formatted Excel file created from WHONET.</p>

                                      <p align="justify">Then return to WHONET and click “Continue” to return to the main analysis screen. </p>
